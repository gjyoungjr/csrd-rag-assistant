      "Final Answer: The guidelines for the environmental aspect of the CSRD directive can be found in Article 29b of the directive. These guidelines specify the information that undertakings are required to report, including information on climate change mitigation, adaptation, water and marine resources, resource use and the circular economy, pollution, biodiversity and ecosystems, equal treatment and opportunities, working conditions, human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic principles, business ethics, corporate culture, political influence, and relationships with customers, suppliers, and communities. The guidelines also take into account the difficulties that undertakings may face in gathering information from actors throughout their value chain and aim to avoid imposing a disproportionate administrative burden. The Commission will review these guidelines every three years and take into consideration relevant developments and international standards.\u001b[0m\n",
