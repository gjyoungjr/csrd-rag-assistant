We’ve \\ncrossed key milestones on our environmental journey. And we’re \\nrising to the generational challenge of climate change by working \\nwith companies and communities that span the globe.\\nApple 2030 is our commitment to be carbon neutral for our entire \\nfootprint by the end of the decade. We’ll get there by innovating \\nat every stage of the product lifecycle — from how they’re made, \\nto what they’re made from.\\nThat starts with bringing new clean energy online across our supply \\nchain. Today, more than 320 suppliers have committed to using \\nrenewable electricity for Apple production. With over 16 gigawatts \\nalready online, they’re avoiding more than 18 million metric tons \\nof greenhouse gas emissions.\\nOur teams and suppliers are a part of so many communities, \\nso Apple’s work to protect the planet takes us around the world. \\nThat’s why we’re partnering directly with communities and local \\norganizations to support environmental solutions where they’re \\nneeded most. In 2023, that meant expanding our Power for Impact \\nprogram to bring clean energy to underserved communities in \\nNepal and Colombia, and supporting programs that increase \\naccess to safe water and sanitation in India.\\nWe’re also building our products with more recycled and renewable \\nmaterial than ever — work that helps to drive down our carbon \\nfootprint. Our customers play an important role in this effort. \\nWhen you participate in the Apple Trade-In program, you’re helping \\nto bring us closer to the day our products will be made without \\ntaking anything from the Earth.\\nThe proof is in our products. Last year, more than 20 percent of \\nthe materials we shipped in Apple products came from recycled \\nsources. MacBook Air is our first product made with more than \\n50 percent recycled material, and we’re making important strides \\nacross all of our products. The iPhone 15 lineup, Apple Watch \\nSeries\\xa09, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 use 100 percent recycled cobalt in \\ntheir batteries. More than 99 percent of the tungsten in our products \\ncomes from recycled sources. And we’re driving innovation \\naround the world to improve the way our industry recycles \\nand recovers materials. \\nWe’re also finding new and better ways to get Apple products into \\npeople’s hands. It’s not just trains, planes, and automobiles\\xa0— \\nincreasingly, we’re shipping Apple products on the open seas, \\nbecause ocean freight can reduce emissions by as much as \\n95 percent compared to air transport. And we continue to restore \\nour planet’s ecosystems — like the Atlantic Forest, which stretches \\nfrom Brazil to Paraguay — that play a key role in removing carbon \\nfrom the atmosphere.\\nWhat does all this work add up to? Progress. And that progress is \\nsorely needed, because the impacts of climate change are all around \\nus. Its frontlines are not in boardrooms or government buildings\\xa0— \\nthey’re in communities. And we owe it to our global community \\nto rise to the challenge of climate change with all the innovation, \\nempathy, and commitment we can muster.\\nLisa Jackson\\nVP, Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives\\n2024  Environmental Progress Report\\x08\\n3\\nEngagement and Advocacy\\nEnvironmental Initiatives\\nData\\nAppendix\\nContents\\nIntroduction']\n",

      "['', 'Apple 2030\\nResources\\nSmarter Chemistry \\nDecarbonizing our value chain\\nElectricity\\nElectricity for manufacturing and charging devices \\nrepresents the largest source of Apple’s emissions \\nacross all product lines. Achieving carbon neutrality \\nfor our entire carbon footprint requires a transition \\nto 100 percent clean energy and significant energy \\nreductions throughout our supplier facilities.\\nWe launched the Supplier Clean Energy Program in \\n2015 to advance\\xa0renewable energy throughout our \\nmanufacturing supply chain. As of March 2024, more \\nthan 320 global suppliers — representing 95 percent \\nof Apple’s direct manufacturing spend — have joined \\nthe program. These suppliers have committed to \\nusing 100 percent renewable electricity for all their \\nApple production by the end of this decade. The \\nsuccess of this initiative has led to the next phase \\nof our efforts toward achieving a carbon neutral \\nsupply chain by 2030.\\nTo rapidly scale and accelerate the progress \\nof the Supplier Clean Energy Program, Apple \\nupdated the Supplier Code of Conduct to require \\nall direct suppliers to transition to renewable \\nenergy in the manufacturing of Apple products. \\nThe codification of this requirement is the next \\nstep in our decarbonization journey and a sign \\nof our commitment to integrate supply chain \\ndecarbonization into our core business decision-\\nmaking. We hope that our approach can serve \\nas a model that other companies can follow.\\nWe’re also working to address emissions from \\nproduct use through investments in renewable \\nenergy so that every watt of electricity associated \\nwith our customers’ product use is matched by\\n clean electricity. We’re prioritizing product efficiency \\nto reduce the electricity use of our products.\\nWe’ve also introduced Grid Forecast, a tool in the \\nHome app that informs U.S.-based users when their \\npower grid has cleaner energy available for use. And \\nwith iOS 16, we launched the Clean Energy Charging \\nfeature in the United States, which looks at the \\nsources of the electricity during expected charge \\ntimes and optimizes for when the grid is using \\ncleaner energy sources like solar or wind. \\nMaterials\\nWe’ve advanced toward our\\xa02030 goal by using \\nrecycled and renewable materials, which often have \\na lower carbon footprint than primary materials. \\nAnd we announced that, by 2025, we plan to use \\n100 percent recycled cobalt in all Apple-designed \\nbatteries, 100 percent recycled tin soldering, \\n100 percent recycled gold plating in all Apple-\\ndesigned rigid and flexible printed circuit boards, \\nand 100 percent recycled rare earth elements\\nin all magnets across new products.18\\nWe’ve pioneered the use of many recycled materials \\nin our products through world-class product \\nengineering, extensive design qualifications, and \\nsupply chain engagement. Our focus is on materials \\nthat will yield significant environmental and social \\nimpacts, even when those materials come with \\nnotable challenges to building circular supply chains. \\nTo read more about our efforts to create circular \\nsupply chains, see the Prioritizing our efforts section. \\nWe intentionally design products to minimize the use \\nof primary (non-recycled) materials and maximize \\nrecycled content as feasible. And year over year, \\nwe innovate and improve manufacturing processes \\nto use materials more efficiently and\\xa0decrease \\nmanufacturing scrap.\\nIn 2023, manufacturing our products accounted \\nfor 59 percent of our gross carbon footprint. This \\nincludes emissions from fuel combustion; heating, \\nventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); refrigeration; \\nuse of fluorinated gases; and other physical or \\nchemical processes (excluding transportation). \\nThese emissions sources vary widely and require \\nuse of diverse technologies and solutions to abate.\\nOur approach is to identify process emissions across \\nour supply chain, like the use of fluorinated gases \\nin display and semiconductor manufacturing, and \\nlaunch targeted programs to address these emissions \\nin partnership with our suppliers, governments, and \\nindustry stakeholders. We continue to launch supplier \\nprograms targeting emissions from manufacturing \\noperations and facilities used to produce Apple \\nproducts, like the Supplier Energy Efficiency Program \\nlaunched in 2015 to help our suppliers optimize their \\nenergy use.\\nTransportation\\nIn 2023, transporting our products to customers \\naccounted for 9 percent of our gross carbon \\nfootprint.

Apple looked at how \\nthese approaches could help balance our residual \\nemissions as we focus on the global urgency to align \\nwith a 1.5° C pathway to scale up carbon removal. \\nFive key criteria drive our exploration:\\n•\\tStage of development: A solution’s stage of \\ndevelopment is important both to meet our Apple \\n2030 target and to reach scale within the time \\nframe needed to stay within a 1.5° C trajectory. \\n•\\tScalability: We consider scalability because the \\nclimate crisis is a collective responsibility, and the \\nimpact of Apple’s solutions should scale beyond \\nour own environmental footprint. \\n•\\tDurability: Removals must be permanent, or if \\nthere’s a risk of reversal, measures must be in place \\nto address those risks and compensate for any \\nreversals for a defined period of time. \\n•\\tCarbon methodology:\\xa0The impacts achieved \\nneed to be accounted for through using a rigorous \\ncarbon accounting methodology that aligns \\nwith quality and consistency of our own carbon \\naccounting systems, including evaluating any \\nuncertainty in the underlying science. \\n•\\tCo-benefits: We evaluated the co-benefits\\nacross different carbon removal technologies. \\nMost carbon removal approaches have the potential \\nto generate additional benefits for biodiversity \\nand communities but can also pose risks.\\nOur review of different available technologies helped \\nus determine that nature-based solutions\\xa0—\\xa0including \\nafforestation, reforestation, and revegetation (ARR) \\nand soil carbon sequestration\\xa0— currently offer the \\nmost comprehensive carbon removal approach.\\nRestore Fund\\nWe launched the Restore Fund in 2019 in partnership \\nwith Conservation International and Goldman Sachs. \\nSince its creation, the fund has invested in three \\ninitiatives that are projected to remove over a million \\nmetric tons of carbon starting in 2025. This fund \\nis\\xa0unique because it aims to change carbon removal \\nfrom a cost to a potentially profitable investment. \\nBy creating a fund that generates both a financial \\nreturn as well as real and measurable carbon impact, \\nwe strive to drive broader change — encouraging \\ncapital investment in carbon removal around the \\nglobe. We developed the Restore Fund as a pilot, \\nand we’re now seeking to expand and improve it \\nso that others can build on our work and scale the \\nmarket for\\xa0nature-based removals.\\nThe first phase of the fund focused on blending \\nresponsible forestry practices with carbon removal \\nand sought to maximize environmental impact, \\nincluding carbon, hydrology, and habitat restoration.\\nAs we focus on eliminating the majority of emissions across the value chain, we’re also addressing emissions we can’t reduce by \\nlooking for high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects.\\n2024  Environmental Progress Report\\x08 36\\nEngagement and Advocacy\\nData\\nAppendix\\nIntroduction \\nContents\\nEnvironmental Initiatives\\nApple 2030\\nResources\\nSmarter Chemistry']\n",

To verify the \\nwaste data quality, we partnered with third-party \\nauditors to conduct sample evaluations, which \\nfocused on waste classifications, waste data \\nrecordkeeping and reporting, and reasonable waste \\ntreatment methods.\\nWe provide all facilities participating in the program \\nwith resources and guidance on how to reduce waste \\nand reuse, recycle, or compost waste. Suppliers at \\nthese locations can also access tools to improve \\nwaste management and, in some cases, onsite \\nsupport. The program is making an impact: In\\xa02023, \\nsuppliers redirected more than 497,000 metric tons \\nof waste from landfills, bringing the total to \\n3 million metric tons since the program’s inception\\xa0\\n— equivalent to eliminating 3.7 million square meters \\nof landfill space. Throughout 2023, 100 percent \\nof\\xa0established final assembly sites maintained \\nzero-waste-to-landfill operations.83\\xa0\\nAnd we’re working on the next challenge in \\nachieving zero waste, which is a level deeper into \\nthe subassembly module suppliers who assemble \\nthe individual components of Apple products. The \\nwaste stream at this level is often more complex than \\nat final assembly sites, but we’re making progress. \\nAs of\\xa02023, more than 300 module suppliers \\nhave participated in Zero Waste Program since \\nits inception — including those who provide core \\ntechnology components, displays, PCB and flex, \\npackaging and enclosures. They’ve diverted more \\nthan 352,000 metric tons of waste from landfills.\\nPushing toward zero-waste innovation\\nWe use novel recycling strategies and approaches \\nto divert greater quantities of waste from landfill in \\nour supplier facilities at greater rates. We also pursue \\nmaterial solutions to impact the waste streams \\ncoming into these facilities to simplify and maximize \\nthe recyclable content that our suppliers work with.\\nPlastics comprise one of the major waste streams \\nin our supply chain. For this reason, we’ve focused \\nour efforts on reducing the amount of plastic waste \\ngenerated during manufacturing. In 2018, we \\npartnered with a key material vendor to develop \\ncomponents that have helped our suppliers reduce \\nwaste. These include recyclable protective films \\n(RPFs) that safeguard products during manufacturing \\nand reusable trays used to securely deliver modules \\nthrough assembly sites.\\nWe’re also working to reduce more complex waste \\nstreams, including processing chemical waste \\nfound further upstream in our supply chain. One \\ntypical process waste is coolant, a chemical material \\nused to cool the surface of machinery involved in \\nmanufacturing components like enclosures. To avoid \\nsending coolant waste to landfill or an incinerator, \\nwe launched a series of coolant reduction initiatives \\n2024  Environmental Progress Report\\x08 54\\nEngagement and Advocacy\\nData\\nAppendix\\nIntroduction \\nContents\\nEnvironmental Initiatives\\nApple 2030\\nResources\\nSmarter Chemistry']\n",

We focused on \\nreducing coolant usage by implementing minimum \\nquantity lubricant (MQL) technology, an ultraviolet or \\nozone approach to recycling coolant, and end-of-life \\nrecycling. These initiatives have reduced more than \\n20,000 metric tons of coolant-containing waste in \\nthe past year.\\nEngaging with suppliers to reduce waste\\nWe work closely with our suppliers to realize our \\nzero-waste goals. This work faces a range of \\nchallenges, including a lack of access to recycling \\ntechnologies, the absence of local infrastructure,\\n and the lower value of recyclable material that \\nimpacts the economics of recycling. \\nIn 2023, we focused on reducing a significant portion \\nof plastics in manufacturing and transportation of \\nour products. With packaging, we’ve already made \\nsignificant progress in transitioning to fiber-based \\nmaterials. We’re now working to extend that success \\nto the packaging module components used by our \\nsuppliers during transportation and at assembly \\nsites. Our suppliers have developed fiber alternatives \\nto replace plastic films, foams, and bags. The initial \\npilot, launched in 2022, focused on reducing waste \\nassociated with iPad; the program now includes \\niPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods. Since this \\neffort began, our suppliers have saved 3,600 metric \\ntons in plastic used while manufacturing and \\ntransporting our products.\\nThe Waste to Resource database we designed \\nprovides access to available technologies and local \\nrecyclers that we’ve recommended by the suppliers \\nwe work with. The database includes information on \\nmore than 1,500 resources across more than 250 \\ncities in China, Thailand, India, and Vietnam\\xa0— a \\nnumber that grows as we and our suppliers share \\nvaluable resources through the database. As more \\nof\\xa0our suppliers achieve their zero-waste goals, we’re \\nable to learn and share more information. We plan to \\nmake this resource public for the benefit of the entire \\nelectronics industry.\\nOne example of a resource benefiting the industry \\nis a tool developed by Apple and UL Solutions, our \\npartner that validates zero-waste efforts. The tool \\nprovides the first-ever supply chain zero-waste \\nmanagement system assurance program, enabling \\nthird-party zero-waste verification at a systems level \\nrather than at a site level. The assurance procedure \\nhas allowed us to accelerate the verification process \\nsignificantly and establishes a new model that \\ncompanies across industries can employ to verify \\nzero-waste programs at scale. This streamlined \\napproach has brought even more suppliers into \\nour program, with more than 185 facilities assured \\nin 2023\\xa0by UL Solutions — 35 more than the \\nprevious year.84\\nWe also provide support for our suppliers in verifying \\ntheir zero-waste efforts. Since launch, the foundation \\nof our Zero Waste Program has followed the UL 2799 \\nZero Waste to Landfill Environmental Claim Validation \\nProcedure (ECVP), which requires at least 90 percent \\ndiversion through methods other than waste-to-\\nenergy. Through this standard, our supplier facilities \\ncan certify against clear benchmarks for waste \\ndiversion, including Platinum, Gold, and Silver levels \\nof verification. We’ve spent the last seven years \\nexpanding this program throughout our supply chain, \\nwith suppliers in China, India, and Vietnam becoming \\nUL validated. Since we switched from individual site \\nverification to system-level verification, suppliers \\nparticipating in the assurance program can easily \\napply their verification statements from UL.\\nSupplier capability development\\nTo address the challenge of waste classification for \\nsuppliers across different countries and regions, \\nwe’ve created the Apple Recommended Waste \\nCategory List that provides standardized guidance \\non how to classify different types of waste. This\\xa0has \\nbeen implemented widely and used by suppliers \\nin the Zero Waste Program. Suppliers have also \\nreceived access to training and coaching on waste \\nclassification to support their efforts in separating \\nwaste while promoting waste reduction, reuse, \\nand recycling. \\nThe data we’ve aggregated summarizes the top \\n10 waste streams — including plastics, papers, \\nand metals — and their corresponding diversion \\nsolutions. This provides a valuable perspective on the \\nwaste footprint across our supply chain; it also shows \\nus where we can expend our efforts on material \\nutilization to reduce the amount of waste sent to \\nincineration or landfill.\\nStarting in 2022, Apple organized a series of \\nwebinars with suppliers, policymakers, and industrial \\nleaders to share their experiences in the Zero \\nWaste Program with participating suppliers and \\nthose who plan to join. These sessions provide an \\nopportunity to discuss lessons learned implementing \\nthe Zero Waste Program, best practices around the \\ncompliance requirements of waste management, and \\nemerging recycling and reduction technologies.\\nWe’re focused on expanding the impact of the Zero \\nWaste Program in our supply chain and beyond. In \\n2023, we launched a zero-waste education initiative \\nin India. Supported by our Supplier Employee \\nDevelopment Fund, we’ve been able to design \\na series of zero-waste-related trainings specific \\nto India for supplier leadership, employees, and \\nmembers of local communities.\\nWe’ve offered several learning programs in India that \\ncover sustainability basics, the roadmap for achieving \\nzero waste, and best practices\\xa0in waste management. \\nThese include supplier classroom sessions in \\nBangalore and Chennai focused on leadership \\ncapabilities and training to help scale the Zero Waste \\nProgram, as well as community e-learning resources \\nto introduce sustainable living, domestic composting, \\nand basic waste management beyond the workplace \\nthat can benefit everyone. \\n2024  Environmental Progress Report\\x08\\n55\\nEngagement and Advocacy\\nData\\nAppendix\\nIntroduction \\nContents\\nEnvironmental Initiatives\\nApple 2030\\nResources\\nSmarter Chemistry']\n",

      "['', 'Appendix A\\nCorporate facilities energy supplement\\nUse of renewable energy at our facilities has been \\na central component of our emissions reduction \\nstrategy since 2011. We’ve learned a lot about how \\nbest to secure renewable energy, which has helped \\nus educate suppliers and expand our renewable \\nenergy efforts into our supply chain. This appendix \\nsummarizes the types of renewable energy solutions \\nwe’ve deployed, and it details how we implement \\nrenewable energy at our data centers — our largest \\nenergy loads.\\nHow we procure \\nrenewable energy\\nSince launching our renewable energy program in \\n2011, we’ve implemented a number of solutions to \\nprocure renewable energy. Our strategy has evolved \\nover time to create the most positive impact.\\n2011\\nOwnership and PURPA:\\xa0Apple’s 100 percent equity \\nownership of our Maiden solar arrays was the first \\ntime a nonenergy commercial company built its own \\nutility-scale solar PV project. We used a 1978 federal \\nlaw called the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act \\n(PURPA) to structure the project. We then applied \\nthis same structure to two more large solar PV and \\nbiogas fuel cell projects in North Carolina and two \\nmicrohydro projects in Oregon. This was a landmark \\nmoment in corporate renewable energy development \\nand led to an increased use of PURPA in these states.\\n2012\\nDirect Access:\\xa0In California and Oregon, we’ve \\nused a program called Direct Access to bypass the \\ndefault electricity generation offered by the utilities \\nservicing our data centers in those states. Instead, \\nwe contracted directly with independent power \\nproducers and electricity service providers who \\ncould supply 100 percent renewable electricity. After \\ninitially buying from existing, third-party-owned \\nprojects, we’re now procuring renewable energy from \\nprojects we created: The Solar Star II and Montague \\nWind projects deliver renewables to our Oregon data \\ncenter, and the California Flats solar project delivers \\nrenewables to our data centers, offices, and retail \\nstores in California.\\n2013\\nGreenEnergy Rider:\\xa0We opened a new data center \\nin Reno, Nevada. With no PURPA or Direct Access \\noptions in Nevada, we worked directly with the local \\nutility, NV Energy, to create a whole new regulatory \\nstructure. The Nevada GreenEnergy Rider enables \\nus to secure a long-term, fixed-price contract for \\nrenewable electricity from a new solar PV project \\nbuilt for us\\xa0but managed by the utility. We’ve used \\nthis partnership to create four solar projects totaling \\n320 megawatts.\\n2014\\nEquity investment:\\xa0We invested in two 20-megawatt \\nsolar PV projects in Sichuan, China, to support \\nall\\xa0our in-country retail stores, corporate offices, \\nand data storage facilities. This project represented \\nthe first time a commercial company created a new \\nlarge-scale project in China for its own use. We’ve \\nsince replicated this model many times for Apple’s \\nsupply chain.\\n2015 & 2016\\nPortfolio solutions:\\xa0We adapted to land scarcity \\nconstraints in Singapore and Japan by contracting \\nfor solar PV on 800 rooftops in Singapore and 300 \\nin Japan. We adapted our approach in each country \\nto fit local partnerships and regulatory structures: \\nWe signed a long-term agreement similar to a power \\npurchase agreement in Singapore and made an \\nequity investment in Japan. These projects offer us \\nlong-term flexibility as our load grows.\\n2017\\nRenewable microgrid:\\xa0We’ve been powering Apple \\nPark with 100 percent renewable energy — more \\nthan 50 percent of which is generated onsite and \\nmanaged by a microgrid. The onsite generation \\ncomes from 14 megawatts of rooftop solar PV and \\n4 megawatts of baseload biogas fuel cells. Any \\nadditional energy required is drawn by Direct Access \\nfrom the California Flats solar project in nearby \\nMonterey County. The microgrid system with battery \\nstorage manages the renewable energy generation \\nand the building’s energy use; optimizes demand \\nmanagement, load shifting, and frequency regulation \\nservices; and ensures uninterrupted energy reliability \\nagainst local grid outages.\\n2024  Environmental Progress Report\\x08 86\\nEngagement and Advocacy\\nEnvironmental Initiatives\\nData\\nIntroduction \\nContents\\nAppendix']\n",

For the remaining elements of Apple’s \\ncarbon footprint, we rely on industry average data \\nand assumptions.\\nThe following details the five steps we use \\nto conduct our LCA:\\nTo model the \\nmanufacturing phase\\nWe use part-by-part measurements \\nof the entire product along with data \\non part production. In some cases \\nwhere part-by-part data is not readily \\navailable, we also use design-level \\ndata for size and weight detail.

The LCA \\nincludes accessories and packaging, \\nas well as decreased emissions \\nthrough Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy \\nProgram. When calculating Apple’s \\ncomprehensive carbon footprint, we \\nalso include units that are repaired and \\nreplaced through AppleCare.\\nPRODUCT LCA PROCESS\\nHow Apple conducts our product greenhouse gas life cycle assessment\\nTo model transportation\\nWe use data collected on shipments \\nof single products and multipack units \\nby land, sea, and air. We account \\nfor transporting materials between \\nmanufacturing sites; transporting \\nproducts from manufacturing sites to \\nregional distribution hubs; transporting \\nproducts from regional distribution \\nhubs to individual customers; and \\ntransporting products from final \\ncustomers to recycling facilities.\\nTo model customer use\\nWe measure the power consumed \\nby a product while it is running in a \\nsimulated scenario. Daily usage patterns \\nare specific to each product and are a \\nmixture of actual and modeled customer \\nuse data. For the purposes of our \\nassessment, years of use, which are \\nbased on first owners, are modeled to \\nbe four years for macOS, visionOS, and \\ntvOS devices and three years for iOS, \\niPadOS, and watchOS devices. Most \\nApple products last longer and are often \\npassed along, resold, or returned to \\nApple by the first owner for others to \\nuse. More information on our product \\nenergy use is provided in our Product \\nEnvironmental Reports.\\nTo model end of life\\nWe use material composition data \\non our products and estimate the \\nratio of products that are sent to \\nrecycling or disposal. For products \\nsent to recycling, we capture the \\ninitial processing by the recycler to \\nprepare the product for recovery \\nof electronic, metal, plastic, and \\nglass material streams. Subsequent \\ndownstream recycling processes are \\nnot included, as these are considered \\nstages of production and not end-of-\\nlife processing. For products sent to \\ndisposal, we capture the emissions \\nassociated with landfilling or \\nincineration of each type of material.\\nPutting it all together\\nAfter we collect data about \\nmanufacturing, use, transportation, \\nand end of life, we combine it with \\ndetailed greenhouse gas emission \\ndata. This emission data is based \\non a combination of Apple-specific \\nand industry-average data sets for \\nmaterial production, manufacturing \\nprocesses, electricity generation, and \\ntransportation. Renewable energy \\nused in the supply chain, initiated by \\nsuppliers independently or through \\nthe Apple Supplier Clean Energy \\nProgram, is also accounted for within \\nthe LCA model.

The scope of the fiber and plastic \\npackaging footprint includes Apple’s corporate packaging fiber and plastic usage from \\nproducts, retail operations and Apple care services. The packaging fiber and plastic \\nfootprint tracks the total amount of plastic, virgin and recycled wood fibre, that Apple uses \\nin packaging. Apple obtains and analyses supplier-specific data for each product line and \\nsums up these figures for the entire company using sell-in numbers. For some products, a \\nrepresentative supplier is chosen to calculate the product-specifc packaging. The output is a \\ntotal packaging fiber and plastic footprint. For labels, beats products and accessories, \\nindividual sell-in numbers were only availabe for a share of products. These were \\nextrapolated for the whole category. ESD packages (within Apple care) are excluded from \\nthe packaging plastic footprint.   \\nThe review of the corporate annual packaging fiber and plastic footprint has considered the \\nfollowing criteria: \\n\\uf0a7 The system boundaries are clearly defined \\n\\uf0a7 Assumptions and estimations made are appropriate \\n\\uf0a7 Use of supplier data is appropriate and methodologies used are adequately \\ndisclosed \\nData reported by Apple is as follows: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCorporate Packaging Fiber and Plastic Footprint \\nReview  \\nClient: Apple Inc. \\n2 \\n2023 \\nTotal \\nVirgin \\nRecycled \\nPlastic w/o \\nadhesives \\n6,400 \\n6,400 \\n--  \\nFiber \\n247,900 \\n89,500 \\n158,400 \\n \\n[metric tons] \\n[metric tons plastic] \\n[metric tons plastic] \\n \\nAll results and figures reviewed for fiscal year 2023 are plausible. \\n \\n2 \\nReviewed Data and Findings \\nAs part of this review Apple disclosed following data to Fraunhofer IZM:  \\n\\uf0a7 Calculation methodology for the corporate packaging fiber and plastic footprint \\n\\uf0a7 Sales data for FY2023, including accessories \\n\\uf0a7 Selected product and supplier specific data on packaging materials and production \\nyields  \\n\\uf0a7 Aggregated packaging fiber and plastic data for all products and the total \\ncorporate packaging fiber and plastic footprint for the fiscal year 2023 \\nThe methodology paper provided by Apple (Packaging Plastic Footprint at Apple – \\nMethodology Description – V1.0 in 2018, Fiber Footprint at Apple - Methodology \\nDescription - V1.1 reviewed in 2017), is considered a sound and appropriate guidance for \\ndetermining the company packaging fiber and plastic. Where appropriate, this approach \\nfollows methodological principles applied for state-of-the-art Life Cycle Assessments.  \\nThis review comprises a check of packaging fiber and plastic data for selected products \\n(Apple watch, iPad, Mac). \\nPlausibility of some data has been questioned and discussed with Apple in detail.

      "['', 'End\\xa0notes\\nIntroduction\\nEnvironmental Initiatives\\n1 \\t Apple follows the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and \\nReporting Standard (GHG Protocol) to calculate value chain \\nemissions. The GHG Protocol currently defines scope 1 emissions \\nas direct greenhouse gas emissions that occur from sources that \\nare owned or controlled by the company; scope 2 emissions as \\nthe indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of \\npurchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling consumed by the \\ncompany; and scope 3 emissions as all “other indirect emissions” \\nthat occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including \\nboth upstream and downstream emissions. Apple currently sets an \\noperational boundary for its emissions and excludes the following \\nscope 3 categories, as defined by the GHG Protocol, which \\ncollectively make up less than 10 percent of our 2015 base year \\nscope 3 emissions currently: “capital goods” due to limited data \\navailability, which limits our ability to influence these emissions, and \\n“waste generated in operations,” as these emissions are negligible. \\nThe following subset of greenhouse gas categories recognized \\nin the Kyoto Protocol are included: carbon dioxide (CO2), \\nmethane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), \\nperfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), Nitrogen \\ntrifluoride (NF3).\\n2\\t Carbon reductions are calculated against a baseline scenario: 1) No \\nuse of clean electricity for manufacturing or product use, beyond \\nwhat is already available on the grid (based on regional emissions \\nfactors). 2) Apple’s carbon intensity of key materials as of 2015 \\n(our baseline year for our 2030 product carbon neutrality goal). \\nCarbon intensity of materials reflects use of recycled content and \\nproduction technology. 3) Apple’s average mix of transportation \\nmodes (air, rail, ocean, ground) by product line across three \\nyears (fiscal years 2017 to 2019) to best capture the baseline \\ntransportation emissions of our products.\\n3\\t As of product launch, 50 percent of all low-carbon watch \\nproducts by weight are planned to be shipped via non-air modes \\nof transportation over the lifetime of the products from our final \\nassembly sites to their next destination — primarily regional \\ndistribution hubs.\\n4 \\t Apple reports data about the recycled content of its products at \\ndifferent levels of fidelity, based on the level of independent data \\nverification. The bulk of Apple’s recycled content data is certified \\nand thus verified by a third party. Less than 3 percent of the total \\nmass shipped in Apple products in fiscal year 2023 contained \\nrecycled content that is either supplier verified, meaning it has been \\nreported by the supplier and cross-checked by Apple, or supplier \\nreported, meaning it has been reported by the supplier based \\non production and allocation values. In all cases, Apple defines \\nrecycled content in alignment with ISO 14021. We do not currently \\n17\\xa0\\tRenewable electricity refers to fossil fuel–free sources of \\nenergy from renewable sources, like wind, solar, and low-impact \\nhydroelectricity projects. Clean electricity refers to both renewable \\nelectricity as well as other projects that Apple considers “low \\ncarbon” but not “renewable,” like nuclear and large-impact \\nhydroelectricity projects. Apple currently only allows for clean \\nelectricity sources to address electricity for product use when part \\nof a residual grid factor, in markets where there is sufficient data to \\nensure that the clean electricity is not already claimed. For Apple’s \\ncorporate footprint, supply chain manufacturing, and the portion of \\nour product use impact that is not already clean electricity, Apple is \\ninvesting in only new renewable electricity sources.\\n18 \\tRefer to footnote 10.\\n19 \\tRefer to footnote 4. \\n20 \\t\\nRefer to footnote 12.\\n21 \\tApple’s commitment is to use 100 percent recycled cobalt, using \\nmass balance allocation, in all Apple-designed batteries by 2025. \\nWe calculate our use of recycled cobalt using mass balance \\nallocation at the end of each fiscal year.\\n22 \\t\\nApple’s commitment is to use 100 percent recycled tin soldering \\nand gold plating in all Apple-designed rigid and flexible printed \\ncircuit boards by 2025. \\n23 \\t\\nApple’s commitment is to use 100 percent recycled rare earth \\nelements in all magnets by 2025.\\n24\\tIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), “Summary \\nfor Policymakers of IPCC Special Report on Global Warming \\nof 1.5°C approved by governments,” press release, www.ipcc.\\nch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-\\non-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments.\\n25\\tCorporate emissions include scope 1 and 2 emissions from Apple \\nretail stores, corporate offices, Apple-owned and colocated data \\ncenters, and Apple-produced digital content for Apple One services, \\nas well as scope 3 emissions associated with business travel, \\nemployee commute, work from home, upstream impacts from \\nscope\\xa01 fuels, and use of third-party cloud services.\\n26\\xa0\\t\\nApple defines low-carbon materials\\xa0as materials created using \\nproduction techniques with reduced carbon impact, such as \\nElysis (a patented technology that eliminates direct greenhouse \\ngas emissions from the traditional aluminum smelting process) or \\naluminum smelted using hydroelectricity instead of coal.\\n27 \\tRefer to footnote 5.\\n28\\tRefer to footnote 4. \\n29 \\t\\nRefer to footnote 21.\\n30\\tRefer to footnote 22. \\n31 \\tRefer to footnote 23.\\n32 \\t\\nSince publishing the “Material Impact Profiles” white paper, we’ve \\nexpanded our analysis to include biodiversity factors.\\n33 \\t\\nTo account for recycled aluminum, we use third-party certified \\nrecycled aluminum data, as well as supplier-verified data, meaning it \\nhas been reported by the supplier and cross-checked by Apple.\\n34\\tThis statistic compares the carbon footprint of aluminum from \\nrecycled sources with primary aluminum smelted with electricity \\ngenerated from coal.\\n35\\tRefer to footnote 21.\\n36\\xa0\\t\\nRefer to footnote 22.\\n37\\tIncluding iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 15 Pro models.
